# cocos2d-gui

This is **not** official GUI package for cocos2d.

**Dependencies**: pyopengl, pyglet, cocos2d

## Installation

In this branch this module is just a submodule of one of my projects, so
I couldn't make a valid `setup.py` script. Just copy the whole folder,
maybe...

## Examples

... will be added later.
